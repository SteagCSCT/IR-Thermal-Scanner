# Open IR-Thermal-Scanner

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. .Screening to detect a potential COVID-19 infected person plays an important role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The use of infrared thermal imaging cameras has been proposed as a noninvasive, speedy, cost-effective and fairly accurate means for the mass blind screening of potential COVID-19 infected persons. 

Infrared non-contact temperature measurement, reduce the risk of cross-infection. Efficient: the detection time is less than 1 second.  It is also limited by the fact that the thermal imager measures the skin temperature and not the core body temperature. 

### Problem Statement: Demands and Shortage of non-contacting Infrared thermometer for the COVID-19. 
### Solution: Build and Distribute non-contacting Infrared thermometer and the building guides will help to solve the problem.
